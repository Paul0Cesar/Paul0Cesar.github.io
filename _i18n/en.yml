  my_description: I have been working in development for over 5 years, during which time I had the pleasure of collaborating with amazing people from whom I endeavored to efficiently absorb essential skills for my career.</br></br>
    More specifically, I am actively engaged in Android development, utilizing the Android SDK to create efficient applications using languages such as Kotlin/Java. I employ design patterns like MVVM and MVP to ensure good separation of concerns, thereby improving long-term maintainability and facilitating the implementation of unit tests.</br></br>
    I haven't confined myself solely to the Android ecosystem but have also gained experience in Backend development, producing some APIs for consumption. I have expertise with various databases, observing firsthand how they can impact the end-user and application performance. Notably, I've had the opportunity to work with cloud platforms to deliver these services, gaining exposure to technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and others for resource management.</br></br>
    Currently, I am actively seeking to deepen my knowledge in web and mobile cybersecurity through courses, Proof of Concepts (POCs), and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.</br></br>
